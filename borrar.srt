2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Amman, Jordan

3
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,000
Let me see it.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,800
How are you feeling?

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,200
It'll be fine. Don't be scared.

6
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll kill you, you cheapskate.

7
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,700
Right, well, enjoy the experience.

8
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,600
Which experience? Death by lynching?

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,700
You know what they do to gays where they come from?

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,500
Yoni, relax. No one will touch you.

11
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,100
Oh, I need a selfie with one of these women in black.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,900
What are those things called?
-Burka.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And don't mess around, Shira.

14
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,200
What are you talking about, it's polite to ask.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Excuse me.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,300
Thank you.

17
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,000
Hey!

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,900
Careful, man.

19
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,500
Oh my god I'm sorry.
-It hit me in the face.

20
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Take it easy.

21
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,200
Yes, yes, okay. Sorry.
-Okay.

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,600
Let me help you.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What?

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I will help you.

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,900
Okay. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,600
Excuse me.

27
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,500
Did you see how he got mad at me?

28
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,800
Rightly so.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Yes mother.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,700
We already had tickets for Al-Al.

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,300
Yeah, at a thousand dollars.
This cost us half, it's another two months in India.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,800
Really "Shawiya, Ya Zalma".
Like, you put the bag in front of him.

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,700
Ok fine.
I don't control you, right?

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,200
Good.
-Good.

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
What, you're not excited?

36
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,800
Excited about what?
-Excited about India.

37
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,200
When we get to India I'll be excited.

38
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,300
Good, come take a selfie.

39
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,100
What made the lights go off?
-No, no, it's probably an air pocket.

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,800
What air pocket?

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,700
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask all passengers to remain seated and fasten their seat belts.

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,600
Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten your seat belts. Thank you.

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,500
You're fastened?
-That's mine.

44
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,300
Must fasten seat belts.

45
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,600
Hey, okay, everything's fine.

46
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,500
Okay.

47
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
Did he say "Tehran?"

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
No, there's no way.

49
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,400
There's no way.

50
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,200
Excuse me.

51
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Sorry.

52
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,000
They will arrest us, Shira, they will arrest us, don't you understand?

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Israelis don't come back from Iran.

54
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay honey, relax. Let's sit back down.

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,700
Everything's fine.

56
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,000
Put, put on your seat belt.

57
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,000
Does that look like Tehran to you?

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't know.

59
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,800
I can't breathe, Shira.

60
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,200
Shhh...

61
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,800
Alright. Good luck.

62
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,300
See you soon, god willing.

63
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,100
God willing.

64
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,300
Shira.

65
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,200
Y-Yoni, I don't feel good.

66
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,700
Sorry...

67
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,000
What's this? I know you.

68
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,200
I was with you at the base in Glilot.

69
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,000
Why are you here, what are you doing here?

70
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,400
Sorry... I don't understand what you're saying.

71
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No, you understand, you understand.
Please, help me, what are you doing here?

72
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,300
What are we doing in Iran?

73
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,400
Sir, this woman is bothering me.

74
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
I don't know what she wants from me.

75
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,200
I apologize, miss.

76
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
How are you, Jila?

77
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay.

78
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,000
Israel - Mossad

79
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,400
So the systems of the Jordanian plane are still under our control?

80
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Excellent. Keep me updated.

81
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,500
Wait a minute, wait a second.

82
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,400
It's a call from the airport in Tehran.

83
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,000
Praise God

84
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
The weather's good here this morning. Very bright and sunny.

85
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,800
The passenger lied, we'll only get the codes
upon landing in Delhi.

86
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That means we have a four hour delay.

87
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We don't have four hours. The pilots will already be at the briefing by then.

88
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
There are other ways to get the codes.

89
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,400
I believe that Tamar can handle it.

90
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,800
This is exactly what we sent the hacker for.

91
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,000
What about the two Israelis?

92
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,500
Detained for questioning.

93
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,800
They bought tickets at the last minute and boarded the plane.

94
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,500
We only heard about it fifteen before take off.

95
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,800
Mike.

96
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,800
I want a full profile on both of them.

97
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,700
In the bathroom I saw an officer from my base.

98
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,300
Have you lost your mind?

99
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,800
I'm telling you, Yoni, I know her.

100
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,800
On Independence Day she became an Officer.

101
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,600
She's so beautiful, I've seen her a million times before.

102
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,500
A million times..
-Alright, enough, sshh. I don't want to hear it.

103
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,000
Yoni, listen for a second...
-Enough, no!

104
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,000
What do you think they'll do to us?

105
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,200
I don't know.

106
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,700
What?

107
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,700
I don't know, Yoni. Enough.

108
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,200
I knew it.

109
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I knew we shouldn't have got on the flight.

110
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,450
Wait a second...

111
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
How beautiful.

112
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,600
What?

113
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,400
What's "what"?

114
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,450
You don't stop worrying even for a moment.

115
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,650
Everything's fine, darling. It'll all work out.

116
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,800
Me?

117
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,650
I'm not worried about you.

118
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,600
I'm worried about the price of the necklace you're looking at.

119
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,600
Do you want it?

120
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,700
Not anymore.

121
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,550
Try it on.

122
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,500
It's fine.

123
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,750
No...

124
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,200
Sorry, I need to answer this.

125
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,100
Try it on.

126
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll be over here. It'll take two minutes.

127
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,950
Yes, Ali.

128
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,800
Hello commander. How are you?

129
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,000
Sorry to interrupt you. I know that you're at the airport.

130
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,800
What's the story? Get to the point.

131
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,650
A flight from Jordan landed an emergency landing with us.

132
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,000
There were two Israelis on board, they were taken to the special wing.

133
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,700
We're already on our way there.

134
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,000
No, there's no need to come.

135
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,400
It's not your job.

136
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,800
Yes sir.

137
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm handling it. Ok? Ok.

138
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,000
Anything else I can help you with?

139
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,900
Well?

140
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,700
Very nice.

141
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,850
What's happening? Who was that?

142
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Nothing, it was Ali. I..

143
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,300
I need to go do something in the field.

144
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,000
Something quick. I'll be back in time for the flight. Alright?

145
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,200
And if I tell you no?

146
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,200
Okay, you. We'll meet at the gate.

147
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,700
Right. I'll be back soon.

148
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,100
Okay, you.

149
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,600
So what do you think about the nuclear deal?

150
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,100
Who needs bombs when the value of our money loses a quarter of its worth every day?

151
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,900
Right.

152
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,900
I earn more every month but it's worth half what it was worth the previous month.

153
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But the people at the top don't care if we live or die.

154
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Where are you from? Where did you grow up?

155
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,600
I grew up in Tehran.

156
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Where?

157
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,300
In "Garden".

158
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,475
Oh, what a neighborhood...

159
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,450
I have family there, the Azizi family.

160
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,050
We had neighbors by that name.

161
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,900
Really? Well, it's a large clan...

162
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,300
The family of Hudadad.

163
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,200
Their son was on the football team.

164
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,000
Nah, not them. Different family.

165
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,300
Sorry to say, but you have a slight accent.

166
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,000
My father was a merchant, and we travelled a lot.

167
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,300
Eventually we settled in Qatar.

168
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,450
Hey! Good for you!

169
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
What's happening here?

170
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,900
Hanging someone.

171
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,000
What did he do?

172
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,400
He was a bank manager.

173
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,000
Embezzled a bunch of oil money.

174
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,900
Please, take this.

175
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,100
Thanks a lot.

176
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,000
Thanks.

177
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,700
Keep it, it's fine.

178
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,200
I can't believe people come to watch this horror.

179
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,300
Is that her?

180
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,600
Put it on speaker.

181
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Hello.

182
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,700
Good afternoon.

183
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,500
Peace to you.

184
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,500
How's the weather?

185
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Bright.

186
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,000
Nice, nice.

187
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,800
You've arrived at the house?

188
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,650
Yes.

189
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,200
And the man is there?

190
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,500
Yes, he's a little stressed.

191
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,450
Do you think the Israeli girl at the airport noticed the switch?

192
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,700
I don't think so, she...

193
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,100
Honestly she was hysterical, they took her for questioning.

194
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,500
Are we going forward?

195
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,500
Jila didn't give us the codes.

196
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,650
Do you have a way around them?

197
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:06,500
I'll have to check...

198
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,490
There's a way. Yes, there's a way.

199
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,850
How?

200
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
I have somebody, some Iranian hacker that I know.

201
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,780
Who's that?

202
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,150
Someone who won't ask questions. He..

203
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,500
He'll want money.

204
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,085
OK, great. Keep me updated.

205
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,300
What's happening?

206
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,000
Are you ready for her break-in?

207
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,050
Yes sir.

208
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,180
In a moment we'll have a connection to the Iranian air force base,

209
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:37,200
she just needs to activate it for us.

210
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,500
And from here I'll be able to control the Iranian radar around the reactor.

211
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,255
It will see what I want it to see.

212
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,360
How much of a window are you giving the pilots?

213
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:46,500
They'll have about five minutes without anti-aircraft fire.

214
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,400
Separate them.
-Yes, commander.

215
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,300
Take it.

216
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,300
Hello

217
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,770
The gate is closing in 20 minutes. Are you coming?

218
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,100
I'll be there in two minutes.

219
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,000
Get them to hold. Tell them who I am and that there's a security issue.

220
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,700
I'll be right there.

221
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,640
It won't matter who you are. 300 people want to fly!

222
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,550
I'll be there in two minutes.

223
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,220
Thank you.

224
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,450
Here's the transcript of their conversation, sir.

225
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,900
OK. Thank you.

226
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,000
What a dick.

227
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:21,900
Ladies and gentlemen, the problem with the plane's computer has been fixed.

228
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,500
We are starting the boarding, please go to the gate. Thank you.

229
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,200
Yes, Faraz.

230
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,300
Sir.

231
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,800
I'm at the airport about the two Israelis.

232
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,200
Yes, I was informed.

233
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:50,350
The girl thinks she saw an Israeli intelligence officer

234
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,000
in an Iranian flight attendant's uniform.

235
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,600
Does that sound right to you?

236
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,000
I don't know.

237
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,400
The Israeli, does she seem credible to you?

238
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,000
There's no reason for her to lie about such a thing.

239
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,800
And assuming she's right, do you think she has a role in it?

240
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,500
She ran into her by mistake.

241
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:17,200
But if it were up to me, I would hold her over night at least.

242
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,180
Maybe she'll remember something else.

243
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,300
Well.

244
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,080
I feel it will do us more harm than good.

245
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,200
We don't need an international incident right now.

246
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,200
Release them. Let them board their connecting flight.

247
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,380
You're going with your wife to Paris, no?

248
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,720
Yes.

249
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,450
Go be with your wife and let Ali take care of it.

250
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,000
Good luck.

251
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,000
I'll pray for her.

252
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,370
Thank you.

253
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,300
Saeed.

254
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,480
I need footage from the camera covering the women's bathroom

255
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,200
from the moment the plane landed. It's urgent.

256
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,950
Yes, commander.
-Where is it?

257
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,500
Wait. Stop.

258
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,400
Go back, go back.

259
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,850
Wait.

260
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,900
Play it.

261
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,650
Look. Here she holds it in her left hand and here in her right.

262
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,200
Yes, boss.

263
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,390
Here, when she came in.

264
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:09,300
And here, six and a half minutes later, when she left.

265
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,300
It may not be the same girl.

266
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,000
I think this is the same person.

267
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,100
Zoom in.

268
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,620
These are two different women.

269
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,700
They switched.

270
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,950
Don't let the plane take off! No matter what! 

271
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yes, commander.

272
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,550
Where's your bag?

273
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,600
Naahid...

274
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,680
That it? Are you done?

275
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
No.

276
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,500
Something serious came up. Very serious.

277
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,350
I must stay.

278
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,840
Ma'am, ma'am...

279
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,400
We have to close the gate, the plane is waiting.

280
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,900
Alright. Just one minute, please.

281
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,410
I have to stay.

282
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,640
Forgive me.

283
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,420
I'll catch the first plane tomorrow.

284
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,000
I took care of everything.

285
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,700
I'll be with you the entire time.

286
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,900
You'll get the Queen's treatment. I promise.

287
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,700
I'll join you tomorrow or the day after.

288
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,840
Sshh...

289
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,950
I'm tired of your empty promises.

290
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,790
How beautiful.

291
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,400
It looks so nice on you.

292
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,100
God is watching over us.

293
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,670
You'll get through this, darling.

294
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,050
With God's help.

295
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,750
Hurry, please.

296
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,520
Sorry.
-Thank you.

297
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,800
Safe trip.
-Thanks.

298
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,490
Well?

299
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,800
Sorry boss, there were orders from above to release the plane.

300
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,000
They took off.

301
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,800
We just received confirmation that the plane took off.

302
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,000
Two Israelis on board, plus Ashraf and the new passenger.

303
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,300
May God help you.
-You as well.

304
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,400
I see you finally got the surgery.

305
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,000
About time! Did you use the surgeon I recommended?

306
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,700
Yes.

307
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,250
Nice, I'm sure he did a great job.

308
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
What, going to work already? At this hour?

309
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,100
Well, you have a good evening, my dear.
-Good evening.

310
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,500
Iran - National Electric Company

311
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,500
Nice! You did the surgery?

312
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,000
When do the bandages come off so we can see?

313
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,100
In a few days.

314
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,500
Are you mad at me?

315
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,450
He's abusing you, Jila.

316
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,700
And you're not the first.

317
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,000
Someone needs to put him in his place.

318
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,550
If you don't, I will.

319
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,200
He's here.

320
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,580
Got called in for some problem.

321
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,200
He's on edge, be careful.

322
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,200
Our agent inside has 40 minutes to pull this off.

323
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,380
Counter.

324
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,000
The pilots are ready to go.

325
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,580
Switch to propulsion mode.

326
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,700
Choshen 1 through 4, you may align on 8-1.

327
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Choshen 1 through 4, ready and waiting on 8-1.

328
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,950
We have a ping from Tehran.

329
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,750
OK, she managed to get in through the backdoor

330
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,300
of the IEC backup system for the Air Force.

331
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,400
She's started accessing the equipment. 

332
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,600
I was told that you were here.

333
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:28,400
Hey! I'm talking to you!

334
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,200
Wait, what happened?

335
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:34,210
I don't understand what's happening, she's not responding.

336
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,600
Come here.

337
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,000
Jila, wait!

338
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,300
Darling!

339
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,010
There's no response.

340
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,850
What's wrong, you slut?
-Hey!

341
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,020
Your husband found out, and now you're upset?

342
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:03,950
Don't fight.

343
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,100
Come on, darling.

344
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,800
Come on, take my cock.

345
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,700
What's this? Who are you?

346
00:46:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Previews not subtitled.
